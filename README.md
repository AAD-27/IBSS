# Inverter Battery Selection Software


#Problem Statement:
With Covid-19 forcing online education and work from home, the need for uninterruptable electricity has gained importance. Inverters are now commonly bought to ensure continuity of electric supply. The selection of right battery for your home appliances based on required back-up is often a challenge

#Solution:
This software aims to provide user an interface to select the quantity and type of home appliances and recommends the battery specifications based on the configuration. The software also stores the selection in database that can be utilized for future use. It uses Tkinter GUI library to give simple drop down menu to the user. Python Imaging Library (PIL) is used to display the selected battery images for the user
